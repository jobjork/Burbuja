# Burbuja

## What is this?

Burbuja (Spanish for bubble) is a graphical simulation tool for generating bubbles (Burbujas) bouncing against each other in a "pool", each containing a title. The Burbujas take turns on being enlarged for a short period of time, during which its contents are displayed.

## How do I run this?
Burbuja is written in Processing 3.4, both in Python and Java. However, the Java implementation is recommended as it supports a custom background image. To run Burbuja, the following is required:

 - Processing v3.4 or later, which can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download/).
 - Python mode for Processing 3, if you choose to run the Python implementation (available for installation within Processing).
 - An idea of which Burbujas to generate.

Once the requirements are installed, open up `Burbuja.pyde` in Processing. Select the title and the contents of your Burbujas by adding titles and contents to the variable `BURBUJAS_LIST`. You may also play around with parameters for screen size, bubble size, fonts and more.

Once you are ready to set your Burbujas loose, press the "play" icon in the left corner.

Enjoy!
