# Burbuja

## What is this?

Burbuja (Spanish for bubble) is a graphical simulation tool for generating bubbles (Burbujas) bouncing against each other in a "pool", each containing a title. The Burbujas take turns on being enlarged for a short period of time, during which its contents are displayed.

## How do I run this?

Burbuja is written in the Python implementation of Processing 3.4. To run Burbuja, the following is required:

 - Processing v3.4 or later, which can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download/).
 - Python mode for Processing 3 (available for installation within Processing).
 - An idea of which Burbujas to generate.

Once the requirements are installed, open up `Burbuja.pyde` in Processing. Select the title and the contents of your Burbujas by adding titles and contents to the variable `BURBUJAS_LIST`. Then press the "play" icon in the left corner.

Enjoy!
